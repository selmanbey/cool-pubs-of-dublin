# Cool Pubs Of Dublin

This project is the final project for Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

It is created from scratch using ReactJS and uses 3rd party APIs to retrieve data (namely, Google Maps JavaScript API and FourSquare Places API).

## To run in the development mode:

* Make sure that you have node.js installed on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Clone or download the project
* Go to project's folder using command line
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the server with `npm start`
* npm will run the server on http://localhost:3000/
* Open your favourite browser (most likely, Chrome/Firefox) and go to that address
(note: the app does not have a production version, so you will be running it in development mode)

## To run in the production mode

* Follow the first four steps above
* Run `npm run build`
* npm will get the build folder ready to be run.
* You may serve it with a static server. For this, first run `npm install -g serve`
* Then run `serve -s build`
* The app will run on http://localhost:5000/
